Here are the instructions for running this project:

Execution Instructions:

1. Arrange all the files in the following file structure. (With the same folder and file names as mentioned below)

Folder - "Project2"
	ProjectTwoMain.java
	SingleSourceShortestPath.java
	MinimumSpanningTree.java
	StronglyConnectedComponents.java
	Folder - "InputFiles"
		input1.txt
		input2.txt
		input3.txt
		input4.txt
		input5.txt
		input6.txt
		input7.txt
		input8.txt
		input9.txt
		input10.txt
		input11.txt
		input12.txt

2. Open terminal/cmd and change the present working directory to the above folder ("Project2").
3. Compile all the four java files in the following order-
	> javac -d . SingleSourceShortestPathAlgorithm.java
	> javac -d . MinimumSpanningTreeAlgorithm.java
	> javac -d . DFSAlgorithm.java
	> javac -d . Proj2AlgoDsMain.java
4. Run the project by executing the following code-
	> java Proj2AlgoDs.Proj2AlgoDsMain

5. After that Select the Algorithm as per your choice and select any input graphs provided as per your choice.

6. Done.
